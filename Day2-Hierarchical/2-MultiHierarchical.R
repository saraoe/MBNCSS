#     MD for the two models, but the BF will always be huge.

# The nested hypothesis being that v_Sd:log_freq = 0.

# model, the null_model is a nested version of the alternative model.
# The savage dickey ratio only applies for nested group-level tests
# This kind of comparison I did you can basically never do for a hierarchical 
# model, since the alternative model is that parameters vary on the group-level
# AS WELL AS between subjects.
# When you use the savage-dickey ratio, you are only testing if there's no 
# group-level difference. 

# Group-level inference ---------------------------------------------------
# To test if there's individual differences in an effect 
# of log-frequency on individual drift rates we should again construct
# a null model and alternative model and use `compare` to compare these. 
# However, usually the target of inference is at the group-level, for the
# group-level we can test nested hypotheses using `hypothesis` and the 
# Savage-Dickey ratio. 
# Thus we only construct an alternative model for all data:
